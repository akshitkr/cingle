A simple function which runs c/c++ files on emacs using a single keystroke.

Currently only works on systems with clang installed and uses the ~vterm~ package.


** Installation:
Clone the repo to your ~.emacs.d~ or ~.emacs~ and ~require~ it in your init file. Vterm and clang are required for this function to work.


** Usage
~run-c-cpp-code~ in a c/c++ buffer should run the file in a vterm window (spawns a new window if there isn't one already).
