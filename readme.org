A simple function which runs c/c++ files on emacs using a single keystroke.

Currently only works on systems with clang installed and uses the ~vterm~ package.


** Installation:
Clone the repo to your ~.emacs.d~ or ~.emacs~ and ~require~ it in your init file. 

If you use ~use-package~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
  (use-package cingle
    :straight (:host github :repo "akshitkr/cingle"
                     :branch "master"))
#+end_src

should work.

** Usage
~cingle~ in a c/c++ buffer should run the file in a vterm window (spawns a new window if there isn't one already).
